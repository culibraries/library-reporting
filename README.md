# Overview
This CU Libraries repository for all things reporting, including but not limited to creating reports from FOLIO data.

This repo both documents and contains the code for running reports. As such the "report" is the basic building block. Each report has its own directory. At minimum, a given report's directory will contain a README.md file. This is the _only_ requirement, however most report directories will contain other items&mdash;perhaps an sql file for example.

It is our intention that this repository serve as the central hub for all reporting documentation. So if a report exists, it should have a a directory and a README.md file, even if it only contains notes or TODOs. In fact, putting notes and TODOs in this file is a great idea! Go for it!
