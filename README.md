# Overview
This CU Libraries repository for all things reporting, including but not limited to creating reports from FOLIO data.

It is our intention that this repository serve as the central hub for all things relevant to reporting (docs, source code and issues). If a report exists or is being worked on it will have an entry on the [current reports](./wiki/current-reports) page or an [issue](./issues) associated with it. Issues are for reports that are actively being worked on. Once reports are further along, they will ultimately get a wiki page to document how to run the report.

# Contributing to this project
There are several ways to contribute. All are welcome.

* You can create a new report
* You can run an [existing report](./wiki/current-reports)
* You can [create an issue](./issues) or comment on one

See the [wiki](./wiki) for steps for running or creating a new report.
